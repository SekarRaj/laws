# CAP

(Consistency or Availability) and Partition Tolerance


> Refer to the consistency documentation too


### Not tolerant to N/W partition
* Client and the Storage system must be in the same network.  
* Highly unlikely in distributed systems

### Availability
* A write followed by a read might not reflect it

### Consistency 
* Write may fail due to unavailablity
